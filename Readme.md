# My local graphql playground

A place where I play with gql concepts to understand them. Things such as `enums`, `subscriptions`,
returning errors for nullable fields vs non-nullable fields, etc. As is the nature of a playground,
it's messy and not really meant for the consumption of anyone else but me.
